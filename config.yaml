# UX Analysis Configuration
# This file defines the analysis criteria and can be extended for different page types

# EXTENSIBILITY NOTE: This config structure supports multiple page type analyses.
# To add new page types (e.g., product_pages, checkout_pages), simply add a new
# section following the same structure as basket_pages below.

    name: "E-commerce Basket Page Analysis"
    description: "Comprehensive UX analysis of shopping basket/cart pages"

    # EXTENSIBILITY NOTE: navigation can be extended to support multi-step journeys
    # Example future format:
    # navigation:
    #   steps:
    #     - url: "{homepage}"
    #     - action: "click"
    #       selector: ".product-link"
    #     - action: "click"
    #       selector: ".add-to-basket"
    navigation:
      target_url: "direct"  # For POC: direct URL access
      fallback_strategy: "capture_current_state"  # Capture whatever state we land on

    # EXTENSIBILITY NOTE: screenshot_config can support multiple captures per journey
    # Future enhancement: capture states like "before_interaction", "after_interaction"
