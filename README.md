## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd BenchmarkAgent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

### Basic Usage

**Run with a config file** (recommended):

```bash
python3 main.py --config competitors.json
```

You'll be prompted to select analysis type, then the tool opens a browser for each competitor site. You navigate, close popups, and press Enter to capture screenshots.

**Specify analysis type** (skip the prompt):

```bash
python3 main.py --config competitors.json --analysis-type product_pages

# Available types: homepage_pages, product_pages, basket_pages, checkout_pages
```

**Manual mode** (for heavily bot-protected sites):

```bash
# Provide your own screenshots
python3 main.py --manual-mode --screenshots-dir ./screenshots --config competitors.json
```

---

## How It Works

The tool follows this simple, reliable workflow:

1. **Select Analysis Type** - Interactive prompt shows all available types
   - Homepage analysis
   - Product page analysis
   - Basket/cart analysis
   - Checkout flow analysis

2. **Interactive Capture Mode** - For each competitor:
   - Browser opens to the URL
   - You navigate, close popups, accept cookies
   - Press Enter when ready → Captures desktop & mobile screenshots
   - Choose: Continue (Y) / Retry (R) / Skip (S)

3. **AI Analysis** - Claude analyzes screenshots against research-backed criteria

4. **Competitive Report** - Generates intelligence report with market positioning

**Two Modes Available:**
- 🌐 **Interactive Mode** (default): Browser opens, you control, tool captures
- 📁 **Manual Mode** (`--manual-mode`): You provide pre-captured screenshots

**Control Options:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` anytime to exit
- Type 'R' to retry screenshot capture
- Type 'S' to skip a competitor

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Interactive Mode)

**Run the analysis - you'll be prompted to select the type:**

```bash
python3 main.py --config competitors.json
```

**What happens:**

1. **Analysis Type Selection Prompt:**
```
📋 Select Analysis Type:

#   Analysis Type    Description
1   Basket/Cart      Analyze shopping cart pages
2   Checkout Flow    Analyze checkout process
3   Homepage         Analyze homepage UX and layout
4   Product Pages    Analyze product detail pages

Select analysis type (1-4):
```

2. **Interactive Capture** - For each competitor:
   - Browser opens to the URL in visible mode
   - You see: *"Navigate to the page and prepare for screenshot"*
   - Close popups, accept cookies, ensure page loaded
   - Press Enter when ready
   - Tool captures desktop & mobile screenshots
   - Prompt: `Continue? ([Y]es / [r]etry / [s]kip):`
     - **Y or Enter** → Continue to next competitor
     - **R** → Retry screenshots for this site
     - **S** → Skip this competitor entirely

3. **Analysis & Report** - Claude analyzes all screenshots and generates competitive intelligence report

### Skip the Prompt (Specify Analysis Type)

If you already know which analysis type you need:

```bash
python3 main.py --analysis-type product_pages --config competitors.json

# Available types: homepage_pages, product_pages, basket_pages, checkout_pages
```

### Analyze Multiple Competitors
```bash
python3 main.py --urls \
  https://www.competitor1.com \
  https://www.competitor2.com \
  https://www.competitor3.com
```

### Custom Configuration File
```bash
python3 main.py --config competitors.json
```

### Specify Claude Model
```bash
python3 main.py --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 --config competitors.json
```

### Manual Mode (For Bot-Protected Sites) 🆕 v1.1.0

For sites with strong bot detection (Amazon, eBay, etc.), use manual screenshot mode:

```bash
# Step 1: Manually capture screenshots
# - Navigate to competitor pages in your browser
# - Save screenshots as: competitor_desktop.png, competitor_mobile.png

# Step 2: Analyze
python3 main.py --manual-mode --screenshots-dir ./my-screenshots --urls https://amazon.com
```

**When to use manual mode:**
- Sites block automated browsers (Access Denied, CAPTCHA)
- Pages requiring login/authentication
- Maximum control over captured state
- One-off competitive audits

## Configuration

### Competitors Configuration

Create a `competitors.json` file:

```json
{
  "competitors": [
    {
      "name": "competitor1",
      "url": "https://www.competitor1.com/basket"
    },
    {
      "name": "competitor2",
      "url": "https://www.competitor2.com/cart"
    }
  ]
}
```

### UX Analysis Criteria

Criteria are defined in YAML files in the `criteria_config/` directory. Each page type has its own criteria tailored to that context:

**Available Page Types:**
- **`homepage_pages.yaml`** - 8 criteria (Value Proposition, Navigation, Hero Section, Trust Signals, Search, Mobile, Content Hierarchy, Performance)
- **`product_pages.yaml`** - 10 criteria (Product Imagery, Add to Cart CTA, Pricing Display, Reviews, Subscription Options, Delivery Info, Trust Signals, Cross-sell, Mobile, etc.)
- **`basket_pages.yaml`** - 10 criteria (Discount Code Field, Shipping Cost Transparency, Delivery Estimates, Payment Methods, Express Checkout, Trust Signals, Basket Summary, CTA Buttons, Saving Features, Mobile)
- **`checkout_pages.yaml`** - 8 criteria (Form Design, Progress Indicators, Guest Checkout, Payment Variety, Error Prevention, Order Summary, Trust/Security, Mobile)

**To customize criteria for a page type:**
1. Open the relevant YAML file in `criteria_config/`
2. Edit criteria definitions, weights, evaluation points, and benchmarks
3. Run analysis - changes are applied automatically

**Example criteria structure:**
```yaml
criteria:
  - id: "discount_code"
    name: "Discount Code Field"
    weight: 1.5
    description: "Placement and clarity of discount code field"
    evaluation_points:
      - "Field visibility and placement"
      - "Clear messaging about code application"
    benchmarks:
      - source: "Baymard Institute"
        finding: "64% abandon if discount codes are confusing"
```

Each criterion is evaluated against Baymard Institute and Nielsen Norman Group benchmarks.

## Output Structure

The tool organizes output by audit run with hierarchical structure:

```
output/audits/
└── 2025-11-20_homepage_pages/          # Audit folder
    ├── _comparison_report.md            # Markdown competitive intelligence report

### Interactive HTML Report

The tool also generates an **interactive HTML report** (`_comparison_report.html`) with rich visualizations and filtering capabilities. Understanding the report sections:

#### **1. Executive Summary**
Four key metrics at the top of the report:
- **Competitors Analyzed**: Total number of successfully analyzed competitors
- **Average Score**: Mean UX score across all competitors (0-10 scale)
- **Top Score**: Highest performing competitor and their score
- **Lowest**: Weakest performing competitor and their score

**Key Insights Box** highlights:
- 🏆 **Market Leader**: Competitor with highest overall score
- 📊 **Most Consistent**: Competitor with most balanced performance across criteria
- 💪 **Industry Strength**: Criterion where the market performs best overall
- ⚠️ **Market Vulnerability**: Criterion where all competitors struggle (opportunity to differentiate)

#### **2. Visual Analysis Charts**

**Radar Chart - Competitive UX Comparison**
- Shows all competitors overlaid on same axes
- Each axis = one UX criterion
- Larger area = better overall performance
- Use to: Quickly identify who leads/lags on specific criteria

**Heatmap - Feature Adoption Matrix**
- Rows = Competitors, Columns = Criteria
- Color coding: 🟢 Green (8-10) → 🟡 Yellow (4-7) → 🔴 Red (0-3)
- Numbers show exact scores
- Use to: Spot patterns and gaps across the competitive landscape

**Bar Chart - Top Performers by Criteria**
- Shows which competitor scores highest on each criterion
- Use to: Identify best-in-class references for each UX element

**Box Plot - Score Distribution**
- Shows score consistency for each competitor
- Box = middle 50% of scores, line = median
- Use to: See who has consistent vs. inconsistent UX quality

#### **3. Filter & Search Panel**

Interactive controls to explore the data:
- **Search Competitor**: Type name to filter competitor cards
- **Minimum Score**: Slider (0-10) to show only high-performing competitors
- **Competitive Status**: Filter by advantages/vulnerabilities/parity
- **Reset Filters**: Clear all filters to see full dataset

Filter count shows: "Showing X of Y competitors"

#### **4. Competitor Profiles**

Each competitor card shows:

**Competitive Position Tier** (badge at top):
- 🟢 **Market Leader**: Score significantly above average (tier 1)
- 🟡 **Strong Contender**: Score at or near average (tier 2)
- 🔴 **Vulnerable**: Score below average (tier 3)

**Performance by Criteria** table with three columns:
1. **Criterion Name**: The UX element being evaluated
2. **Status Badge**: Competitive intelligence label
   - 🟢 **Advantage**: Scores above market average on this criterion (competitive threat)
   - 🟡 **Parity**: Scores at market average (table stakes)
   - 🔴 **Vulnerability**: Scores below market average (exploitable weakness)
3. **Score**: Numerical score (0-10) with color coding

**Understanding Status Labels:**
- **Advantage** doesn't mean "good" - it means "better than competitors" (even a 7/10 can be an advantage if everyone else scores 5/10)
- **Vulnerability** doesn't mean "bad" - it means "worse than competitors" (even a 7/10 can be a vulnerability if everyone else scores 9/10)
- **Status is relative to the competitive set**, not absolute benchmarks

**Screenshots Section**:
- Desktop and mobile viewport screenshots
- Click any screenshot to open **lightbox** (full-screen view)
- ESC key or click outside to close lightbox
- Annotated screenshots show top strengths (green badges) and weaknesses (red badges)

**Strategic Insights**:
- Competitive positioning summary
- Key differentiator (if any)
- Links to detailed findings in individual analysis JSON

#### **5. Interactive Features**

**Lightbox Gallery**:
- Click any screenshot → Full-screen modal opens
- Shows competitor name and viewport (desktop/mobile)
- ESC key or click backdrop to close
- Prevents page scroll when open

**Real-time Filtering**:
- All filters work instantly (no page reload)
- Combine multiple filters (search + score + status)
- Results update live as you type/adjust sliders

**Responsive Design**:
- Report adapts to screen size
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Charts resize for readability

#### **How to Use the Report**

**For Strategic Planning:**
1. Check Executive Summary → Identify market leader
2. Review Market Vulnerability insight → Find differentiation opportunities
3. Use Heatmap → Spot patterns and white space

**For Competitive Benchmarking:**
1. Use Search filter → Find specific competitor
2. Review their Advantages/Vulnerabilities
3. Check Bar Chart → See where they lead the market

**For UX Prioritization:**
1. Look at Industry Strength → These are table stakes
2. Find Market Vulnerability → Opportunity to lead
3. Check your position on each criterion → Plan improvements

**For Executive Presentations:**
1. Use Radar Chart → Show competitive positioning visually
2. Reference Key Insights box → Quick strategic summary
3. Screenshots with annotations → Show specific examples

### Individual Competitor Analysis

Each competitor gets `analysis.json` with:
- Competitive position assessment
- Criterion scores with competitive status
- Competitive advantages (threats)
- Exploitable vulnerabilities (opportunities)
- Unmet user needs identified

## Architecture & Extensibility

This POC is designed for easy extension to other page types and analysis scenarios:

### Extension Points

#### 1. Adding New Page Type Analysis

To analyze different page types, simply add a YAML file to `criteria_config/`:

**Example:** `criteria_config/landing_pages.yaml`

```yaml
name: "Landing Page Analysis"
requires_interaction: false
viewports:
  - name: "desktop"
    width: 1920
    height: 1080
  - name: "mobile"
    width: 375
    height: 812

criteria:
  - id: "hero_messaging"
    name: "Hero Messaging Clarity"
    weight: 1.8
    description: "Clarity and impact of main value proposition"
    evaluation_points:
      - "Clear primary message"
      - "Benefit-focused copy"
      - "Strong call-to-action"
    benchmarks:
      - source: "Nielsen Norman Group"
        finding: "Users decide in 10 seconds if page is relevant"
  # ... add more criteria
```

2. Run analysis with `--analysis-type` flag:
```bash
python3 main.py --analysis-type landing_pages --config competitors.json
```

**No code changes required!** The system automatically:
- Loads your new YAML config
- Makes it available as an analysis type option
- Generates competitive intelligence reports using your criteria

#### 2. Supported Page Types

Out of the box, the tool includes:

- **`homepage_pages`**: Homepage analysis (8 criteria)
- **`product_pages`**: Product detail pages (9 criteria)
- **`basket_pages`**: Shopping cart pages (10 criteria)
- **`checkout_pages`**: Checkout flow (8 criteria, requires interaction)

Each optimized with page-specific UX criteria and benchmarks.

#### 3. Adding Multi-Step Journeys

Future enhancement to support navigation flows:

```yaml
navigation:
  steps:
    - url: "{homepage}"
    - action: "click"
      selector: ".product-link"
    - action: "click"
      selector: ".add-to-basket"
```

The `JourneyCapture` class in `src/analyzers/screenshot_capture.py` provides the framework for this.

#### 4. Customizing Analysis Prompts

The `ClaudeUXAnalyzer` class (`src/analyzers/claude_analyzer.py`) builds prompts dynamically from config criteria, making it work with any analysis type.

#### 5. Adding New Output Formats

Extend `ReportGenerator` class (`src/utils/report_generator.py`):

```python
class HTMLReportGenerator(ReportGenerator):
    def generate_html_report(self, analysis_results):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

## Current Limitations

Some intentional limitations in the current implementation:

1. **Single URL per Competitor**: Currently analyzes one URL per competitor. Multi-step journeys (e.g., homepage → product → basket) are architecturally supported but not yet implemented.

2. **Sequential Analysis**: Competitors are analyzed one at a time. Could be parallelized for faster execution.

3. **Screenshot-Only Analysis**: Currently analyzes visual screenshots only. Could be enhanced to include DOM/HTML analysis for additional technical insights (accessibility, performance metrics, etc.).

## Use Cases

This tool is designed for:

- **E-commerce UX Teams**: Automate competitive UX analysis across page types
- **Conversion Optimization**: Identify competitive gaps and opportunities
- **Product Managers**: Benchmark against competitors systematically
- **UX Researchers**: Scale qualitative analysis with AI assistance
- **Agencies**: Deliver competitive intelligence audits faster
- **Strategy Teams**: Market positioning and feature gap analysis
